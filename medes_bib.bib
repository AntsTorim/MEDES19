	abstract = {Formal Concept Analysis, as a mathematical tool, has been applied successively in diverse fields such as data mining, conceptual modeling, social networks, software engineering, and the semantic web, to cite but a few. One of the utter shortcoming of Formal Concept Analysis, however, is the large number of formal concepts that are extracted from even reasonably sized formal contexts. This overwhelming number was a key hindrance for a larger utilization of the technique (FCA). To overcome this shortcoming, only extracting a minimal coverage of formal concepts could be a remedy. Even though this task has been shown to be NP-hard, it attracted the attention of many researchers. In this paper, we introduce a new gain function based approach, called QualityCover, for the extraction of a pertinent coverage of a formal context. This algorithm operates akin to a greedy approach and relies on the assessment of a measure of correlation for the selection of the formal concepts to be retained in the final coverage. Extensive experiments show that QualityCover obtains very encouraging results versus those obtained by pioneering approaches in the literature.},

The best decision is defined here as a decision that achieves the greatest value of a weight function. In our paper we first review computationally simple weight function for defining the best decision which does not account for the dependencies between the attributes. Then we define decision as a branch in a decision tree and introduce a weight function that takes those dependencies into account. As search-space for such decision grows factorially with the number of attributes, efficient pruning techniques are necessary. We define three pruning techniques that can be applied in combination. We present some empirical data to demonstrate the effectiveness of such techniques. Key-Words: data mining, decision tree, best decision, optimization, algorithms},

All these algorithms are Monotone System algorithms and have been created in our department within several years. Main aim of these algorithms is to summarize entire data table with one “average” object called best decision (BD) and to open the hidden inner structure of the data table. The BD object is defined here as one that gives the maximal value to the weight function. At first we give a review of a computationally simple weight function to define BD which does not account for the dependencies between the attributes and we describe a method named Scale of Conformity to implement it. We describe several table reordering techniques based on that scale. Finally we define a BD as a branch in the decision tree and introduce a weight function that takes attribute dependencies into account. We present some examples to demonstrate effectiveness of such techniques.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method of decomposition of an n×m binary matrix I into a Boolean product A○B of an n×k binary matrix A and a k×m binary matrix B with k as small as possible. Attempts to solve this problem are known from Boolean factor analysis where I is interpreted as an object–attribute matrix, A and B are interpreted as object–factor and factor–attribute matrices, and the aim is to find a decomposition with a small number k of factors. The method presented here is based on a theorem proved in this paper. It says that optimal decompositions, i.e. those with the least number of factors possible, are those where factors are formal concepts in the sense of formal concept analysis. Finding an optimal decomposition is an NP-hard problem. However, we present an approximation algorithm for finding optimal decompositions which is based on the insight provided by the theorem. The algorithm avoids the need to compute all formal concepts and significantly outperforms a greedy approximation algorithm for a set covering problem to which the problem of matrix decomposition is easily shown to be reducible. We present results of several experiments with various data sets including those from CIA World Factbook and UCI Machine Learning Repository. In addition, we present further geometric insight including description of transformations between the space of attributes and the space of factors.},

The results emphasize the significance of factorizations that provide from-below approximations of the input matrix. While the previously proposed algorithms do not consider the possibly different significance of different matrix entries, our results help measure such significance and suggest where to focus when computing factors. An experimental evaluation of the new algorithm on both synthetic and real data demonstrates its good performance in terms of good coverage by the first few factors as well as a small number of factors needed for an almost exact decomposition and indicates that the algorithm outperforms the available ones in these terms. We also propose future research topics.},
